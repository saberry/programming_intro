## Software Installation

### R

We will start by downloading <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">R</a>.

Why R?

### RStudio

Learning and using R is much easier with an integrated development environment (IDE). For your R work, we would recommend that you use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio</a>.

Why use an IDE?

### Google Colab

Throughout the program, you'll find yourself using Python (in courses and for your own uses). Likely the easiest way to start is with a *notebook*. A Colab notebook comes with most packages that you would want to use and makes sure they are largely compatible with the running Python version. 

## Your Computer & You
